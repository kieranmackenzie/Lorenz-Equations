# Lorenz-Equations
Quick plot showing the ordinary differential equations called the "Lorenz Equations". Using the values sigma = 10, beta = 8/3 and rho = 28 (and values close to these), the solutions to the ODE are chaotic. Wanted to try out the ode45 function in MATLAB and thought this would be a good system of equations to model.
